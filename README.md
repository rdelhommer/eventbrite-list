# EventBrite Event List Widget
This widget can be used to list events for a particular organizer.  I haven't tested it with other use cases at this time.

## Usage
Embed the widget with an iframe and include an organizer id and token in the url params.  Whatever params you provide are appended to the events/search API query.
```html
<iframe style="height:100vh;width:100%" src="https://rdelhommer.github.io/eventbrite-list/?organizer.id=13839265448&token=JLMWBOJRBAWINRIWD4UJ"></iframe>
```

## Contributions
As the usage of this widget is fairly narrow at this time, all contributions are welcome and encouraged. <3
